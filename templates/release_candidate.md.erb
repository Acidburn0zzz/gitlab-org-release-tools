## Preparation

- [ ] Create [preparation MRs] for this version and add the links below:
    ```sh
    # In the release-tools project:
    bundle exec rake "patch_merge_request[<%= version %>]"
    ```

  * CE:
  * EE:
- [ ] Cherry-pick changes into preparation MRs following their instructions
- [ ] Ensure the CE preparation MR has been fully merged into the EE counterpart
- [ ] Merge the preparation branches
- [ ] Cherry-pick [remaining merge requests] labeled <%= PickIntoLabel.for(version) %>
- Check the following list of critical issues/MRs which are to be included in `<%= version %>`. Ensure each has made both CE and EE:
  - [ ] REFERENCE_TO_MR_TO_PICK
- [ ] Ensure builds are green on [Omnibus CE stable branch] and [Omnibus EE stable branch]

[Omnibus EE stable branch]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>

## Packaging

  - [ ] [Sync stable branches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/push-to-multiple-remotes.md) for CE, EE, and Omnibus to `dev`; CE and Omnibus to `github`.
  - [ ] Check for any problematic migrations in EE, and paste the diff in a snippet: `git diff -M v<%= version %>-ee..<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %> -- db/migrate db/post_migrate ee/db/migrate ee/db/post_migrate` =>
  - [ ] Tag the `<%= version %>` version using the [`release` task]:

    ```sh
    # In the release-tools project:
    bundle exec rake "release[<%= version %>]"
    ```
- [ ] Check progress of [EE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: true) %>) and [CE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: false) %>)
    - This might take a while (around 80 min).
    - We only need the EE packages to finish to continue with next steps.

## Deploy

Deploys to production require confirmation from a production team member before
proceeding. Use `!oncall prod` in the `#production` channel to find who's on
call and ping someone. Deploys to staging or canary can be done at will, just
mention it in the `#production` channel.

- [ ] Warm up the packages on takeoff by running:

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -v <%= version %>.ee.0 -w
    ```

### staging.gitlab.com

- [ ] Notify #production that you're about to deploy on **staging**
- [ ] On video call, [deploy] `<%= version %>` to **staging.gitlab.com**

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -e staging -v <%= version %>.ee.0
    ```
- [ ] Comment with the output of the migrations from the takeoff script in this issue

#### QA

- [ ] Announce with an `@product-team` mention in the `#product` Slack channel: ``@product-team `<%= version %>` has been deployed to staging.``
- [ ] Create a "QA Task" issue in the [gitlab-org/release/tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/tasks) repo
- [ ] Wait for the QA Task deadline to pass

### canary.gitlab.com

- [ ] Notify #production that you're about to deploy on **canary**
- [ ] On video call, [deploy] `<%= version %>` to **canary.gitlab.com**

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -e canary -v <%= version %>.ee.0
    ```

### gitlab.com (production)

- [ ] Get confirmation from a production team member to deploy **production**
- [ ] On video call, [deploy] `<%= version %>` to GitLab.com

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -e production -v <%= version %>.ee.0
    ```
- [ ] Take notes of the time it took for the migrations to complete on the deploy to production:
    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project
    bundle exec rake "follow_migrations[production]"
    ```
