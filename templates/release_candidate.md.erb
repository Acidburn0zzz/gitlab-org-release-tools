## Packaging

- [ ] [Sync stable branches from  the latest successful auto-deploy branch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/push-to-multiple-remotes.md) to `dev`
- [ ] Create our stable branches - if first RC of the month

   ```sh
   # In Slack:
   /chatops run release stable_branch <%= version %> <auto-deploy branch>
   ```

- [ ] Tag `<%= version %>`:

   ```sh
   # In Slack:
   /chatops run release tag <%= version %>
   ```
- [ ] Check progress of [EE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: true) %>) and [CE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: false) %>)
    - This might take a while (around 80 min).
    - We only need the EE packages to finish to continue with next steps.

## Deploy

### pre.gitlab.com

- Pre deploys via the [deployer pipeline](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/deployer) happen automatically as soon as the
  [EE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: true) %>)
  reaches the `gitlab_com:upload_deploy` stage of the pipeline.

- This package shall not reach the rest of the production environment as we want to keep production on the auto-devops process

## Release

- [ ] Publish the packages via ChatOps:
  ```
  # In Slack:
  /chatops run publish <%= version %>
  ```
- [ ] Verify that packages appear on [`packages.gitlab.com`](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/unstable)
- [ ] Verify that Docker images appear on `hub.docker.com`: [EE](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ee/tags) / [CE](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ce/tags)
