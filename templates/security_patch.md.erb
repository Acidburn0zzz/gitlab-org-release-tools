**General guidelines**

- Be sure to follow the [Security Releases general information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/process.md) and [Security Releases as Release Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/release-manager.md).
- Always work on [https://dev.gitlab.org/](https://dev.gitlab.org/). Do not push anything to [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)
- Deployment tasks (staging, production canary VMs, and production) should be done only if the patch is for the latest version. Feel free to delete those sections if they don't apply.

## Preparation

- [ ] If this is a critical security release replace the all the `Merge security merge requests using chatops` tasks with ` Merge security merge requests using gitlab UI`
- [ ] Merge security merge requests using chatops:
   ```sh
   # In Slack:
   /chatops run release merge --security
   ```
- [ ] If any merge requests could not be merged, investigate what needs to be done to resolve this issues. Do **not** proceed unless it has been determined safe to do so.

### Auto-Deploy - only for the latest version

The following steps should ideally be completed w/i 1 day

- [ ] Notify `#development` that auto-deploy will be disabled until the security release is out
- [ ] Ensure latest auto-deploy branches are sync'd across .com and dev
- [ ] Disable auto-deploy [pipeline schedules]:
    - [ ] Disable the `Auto-deploy MR picker` job
    - [ ] Disable the `Auto-deploy tagging` job
    - [ ] Disable the `Auto-deploy branch creation` job
- [ ]  Merge security merge requests using chatops:
   ```sh
   # In Slack:
   /chatops run release merge --security --master
   ```
- [ ] manually cherry pick EACH security fix into the CURRENT auto-deploy branch, both gitlab and omnibus
   ```sh
   # fetch both remotes
   git fetch origin
   git fetch dev

   # sync current auto-deploy branch on dev
   git checkout -b CURRENT_AUTO_DEPLOY_BRANCH --track dev/CURRENT_AUTO_DEPLOY_BRANCH
   git pull origin CURRENT_AUTO_DEPLOY_BRANCH
   git push dev

   # get a list of all the merge commits on dev/master not available on origin/master
   git log origin/master..dev/master --merges | grep "^commit"

   # cherry-pick each commit on that list in the current auto-deploy branch
   git cherry-pick -m 1 -x COMMIT_ID

   # push to dev
   git push dev
   ```
- [ ] Modify the `Auto-deploy tagging` job - add `ENV` variable `SECURITY` set to `true` on [pipeline schedules]

- [ ] Manually kick off `Auto-deploy tagging` job from [pipeline schedules]

- This will automatically deploy to staging, if successful this will also create a QA issue
- [ ] Ensure this makes it through to canary

- [ ] Modify the `Auto-deploy tagging` job - remove `ENV` variable `SECURITY` on [pipeline schedules]
- [ ] After the QA deadline has passed, proceed to push this to production


## Packaging

- [ ] **Push `omnibus-gitlab/<%= version.stable_branch %>` to `dev` only: `git push dev <%= version.stable_branch %>`**
- [ ] Ping the Security Engineers so they can get started with the blog post. The blog post should also be done on https://dev.gitlab.org/ in a **private snippet**: BLOG_POST_SNIPPET

- [ ] Ensure [tests are green in CE] and [green in EE]
   ```sh
   # In Slack:
   /chatops run release status --security
   ```
- [ ] Tag `<%= version.to_patch %>`:
   ```sh
   # In Slack:
   /chatops run release tag --security <%= version.to_patch %>
   ```
- [ ] Check that [EE packages are built] and [CE packages are built]

## Deploy

###  Deploy to Pre for QA testing

- [ ] Verify that pre.gitlab.com is running the latest patch version
  - Check in Slack `#announcements` channel
  - Go to https://pre.gitlab.com/help

#### QA

The [QA task issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/tasks/issues?label_name%5B%5D=QA+task)
is manually generated, you can do so as follows:

```sh
# In Slack, replacing LAST_DEPLOYED_VERSION with the appropriate value:
/chatops run release qa --security vLAST_DEPLOYED_VERSION v<%= version %>
```

- [ ] Notify @appsec-team that packages are ready for QA
  ```sh
  # In Slack
  @appsec-team - Security release packages are available for QA.
  ```
- [ ] Wait for the QA tasks deadline to pass.

## Release

- [ ] This section should be done in coordination with the Security team, so **make sure to confirm with them before proceeding**
  ```sh
  # In Slack
  @appsec-team - We are ready to publish the security release packages for <%= version %>, please let us know if the blog post is ready.
  ```

- [ ] Publish the packages via ChatOps:
  ```
  # In Slack:
  /chatops run publish <%= version %>
  ```
- [ ] Create the `<%= version %>` version on [version.gitlab.com](https://version.gitlab.com/versions/new?version=<%= version %>). **Be sure to mark it as a security release.**
- [ ] In the `#content-updates` channel, share a link to the blog post:
   ```
   :tada: GitLab <%= version %> has been released: BLOG_POST_URL
   ```
- [ ] Push `ce/master` to all remotes
- [ ] Push `ee/master` to all remotes
- [ ] Push `omnibus/master` to all remotes

### Auto-Deploy - only for the latest version

- [ ] Enable auto-deploy [pipeline schedules]:
    - [ ] Enable the `Auto-deploy MR picker` job
    - [ ] Enable the `Auto-deploy tagging` job
    - [ ] Enable the `Auto-deploy branch creation` job
- [ ] Manually kick off creating a new auto-deploy branch from [pipeline schedules]
      This will bring auto-deploy back online and contain our security fixes plus
      any new merge requests since auto-deploy was paused.
