## Preparation

- [ ] Create [preparation MRs] for this version and add the links below:
    ```sh
    # In the release-tools project:
    bundle exec rake "patch_merge_request[<%= version %>]"
    ```

  * CE:
  * EE:

- [ ] Cherry-pick changes into preparation MRs following their instructions
- [ ] Ensure the CE preparation MR has been fully merged into the EE counterpart
- [ ] Merge the preparation branches
- [ ] For `omnibus-gitlab` cherry-pick [remaining merge requests] directly into CE stable branch. Then, merge the CE Omnibus stable branch into EE.
- Check the following list of critical issues/MRs which are to be included in `<%= version %>`. Ensure each has made both CE and EE:
  - [ ] REFERENCE_TO_MR_TO_PICK
- [ ] Ensure builds are green on [Omnibus CE stable branch] and [Omnibus EE stable branch]

[preparation MRs]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/picking-into-merge-requests.md
[remaining merge requests]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&label_name[]=Pick%20into%20<%= version.to_minor %>
[Omnibus CE stable branch]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.stable_branch %>
[Omnibus EE stable branch]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>

## Packaging

- [ ] [Sync stable branches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/push-to-multiple-remotes.md) for CE, EE, and Omnibus to `dev`
- [ ] Check for any problematic migrations in EE, and paste the diff in a snippet: `git diff -M v<PREVIOUS_TAG>-ee..<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %> -- db/migrate db/post_migrate ee/db/migrate ee/db/post_migrate` =>
- [ ] Tag the `<%= version %>` version using the [`release` task]:

  ```sh
  # In the release-tools project:
  bundle exec rake "release[<%= version %>]"
  ```
- [ ] While waiting for packages to build, now is a good time to [prepare the blog post]. Look at previous MRs for examples. => BLOG_POST_MR
- [ ] Check progress of [EE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: true) %>) and [CE packages build](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/commits/<%= version.to_omnibus(ee: false) %>).
    - This might take a while (around 80 min).
    - We only need the EE packages to finish to continue with next steps.

## Deploy

Deploys to production require confirmation from a production team member before
proceeding. Use `!oncall prod` in the `#production` channel to find who's on
call and ping someone. Deploys to staging or canary can be done at will, just
mention it in the `#production` channel.

- [ ] Warm up the packages on takeoff by running:

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -v <%= version %>-ee.0 -w
    ```

### staging.gitlab.com

- [ ] Inform the oncall in the #production channel about **staging** deploy
- [ ] On video call, [deploy] `<%= version %>` to **staging.gitlab.com**

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -e staging -v <%= version %>-ee.0
    ```
- [ ] Comment with the output of the migrations from the takeoff script in this issue

#### QA

- [ ] Create a "QA Task" issue in [gitlab-org/release/tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/tasks) using the `QA-task` template.
- [ ] Wait for the QA Task deadline to pass

### canary.gitlab.com

- [ ] Inform the oncall in the #production channel about **canary** deploy
- [ ] On video call, [deploy] `<%= version %>` to **canary.gitlab.com**

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -e canary -v <%= version %>-ee.0
    ```

### gitlab.com (production)

- [ ] Get confirmation from a production team member to deploy to **production**
      In `#production`, use `!oncall prod` to find who's on call, and `@mention` them asking to deploy to production
- [ ] If someone besides the oncall confirms, `@mention` the oncall so they are aware.
- [ ] On video call, [deploy] `<%= version %>` to GitLab.com

    ```sh
    # In the takeoff project:
    bin/takeoff-deploy -e production -v <%= version %>-ee.0
    ```
