### First working day after 7th

Stable branch should be created after the 7th. The 7th is the last date to reliably get things in.

- [ ] Create the <%= version.picking_label %> group label if it doesn't exist: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/labels/new
  - Title: `Pick into <%= version.to_minor %>`
  - Description:

    ```
    Merge requests to cherry-pick into the `<%= version.stable_branch %>` branch. Remove the label once picked.
    ```
- [ ] In `#development`:

    ```
    @channel

    I am about to create the `<%= version.stable_branch %>` branch. Everything merged into `master`
    after this point will go into next month's release. Only regression and security fixes
    will be cherry-picked into `<%= version.stable_branch %>`.

    Please ensure that merge requests have the correct milestone (`<%= version.to_minor %>` for this release)
    and the `Pick into <%= version.to_minor %>` label.

    From now on, please follow the "After the 7th" process:
    https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#after-the-7th
    ```
- [ ] Create branch `<%= version.stable_branch %>` from CE `master` manually
- [ ] Create branch `<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>` from EE `master` manually
- [ ] In Omnibus create both `<%= version.stable_branch %>` and `<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>` from `master` manually
- [ ] Merge Gitlab CE into EE on stable branches following the [Merging a CE stable branch into its EE counterpart] guide
- [ ] Sync stable branches: CE, EE, and Omnibus to `dev`, CE and Omnibus to `github`
- [ ] Sync master branches to `dev` and `github`, as the CHANGELOG will be automatically updated on master during tagging
- [ ] If needed, sync tags for dependencies (`gitlab-shell`, `gitlab-workhorse`, `gitlab-pages`, `gitaly`) to `dev` and `github` (when applicable. Builds should fail if this is needed.)

#### RC1

- Follow the [Creating RC1] guide:
  - [ ] Create MR on CE master updating the "Installation from Source" guide, creating the "Update" guides
  - [ ] Create MR on EE master creating the "CE to EE" guides
  - [ ] Create MR on CE master updating the gitignore and license templates
  - [ ] Create MR on CE master updating the dependencies license list
  - [ ] Ensure above MRs are merged and marked <%= version.picking_label %>
- Follow steps to create a release candidate
  - [ ] Create preparation MRs by following the [instructions in release-tools](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-tools/blob/master/doc/picking-into-merge-requests.md).
  - [ ] Cherry-pick changes into preparation MRs following their instructions
  - [ ] Cherry-pick remaining merge requests labeled <%= version.picking_label %> using this [Merged MRs list]
  - Check the following list of critical issues/MRs which are to be included in `<%= version.to_patch %>`. Ensure each has made both CE and EE
      - [ ] REFERENCE_TO_MR_TO_PICK
  - [ ] If you didn't merge CE into EE in the preparation branches, or if the CE stable branch had additional commits, merge CE `<%= version.stable_branch %>` into EE `<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>` following the [Merging a CE stable branch into its EE counterpart] guide. (In general this should be unnecessary.)
  - [ ] Ensure builds are green on [Omnibus CE stable branch] and [Omnibus EE stable branch]
  - [ ] Sync stable branches: CE, EE, and Omnibus to `dev`, CE and Omnibus to `github`
  - [ ] Sync master branches to `dev` and `github`, as the CHANGELOG will be automatically updated on master during tagging
  - [ ] If needed, sync tags for dependencies (`gitlab-shell`, `gitlab-workhorse`, `gitlab-pages`, `gitaly`) to `dev` and `github` (when applicable. Builds should fail if this is needed.)
  - [ ] Check for any problematic migrations in EE (EE migrations include CE ones), and paste the diff in a snippet: `git diff LATEST_PATCH_TAG-ee..<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %> -- db/migrate db/post_migrate` =>
  - [ ] In `#releases`: I'm going to tag `<%= version.to_rc %>`
  - [ ] Tag the `<%= version.to_rc %>` version using the [`release` task]:

#### QA

### Anytime after RC1 but before 22nd

- [ ] Update the [blog post] `barometer section` with the migration types for this release, including the time they took to complete.
- [ ] Create another RC as needed.

Keep in mind that:

1. After feature freeze only regression and security fixes can be
cherry-picked into `<%= version.stable_branch %>`.
2. Last RC should point to the same commit as the final release.

**Copy-paste the tasks below for any other RCs (be sure to update the RC number).**
