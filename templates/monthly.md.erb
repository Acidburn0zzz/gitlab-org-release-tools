### First working day after 7th

Stable branch should be created after the 7th. The 7th is the last date to reliably get things in.

- [ ] Create the <%= version.picking_label %> group label if it doesn't exist: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/labels/new
  - Title: `Pick into <%= version.to_minor %>`
  - Description:

    ```
    Merge requests to cherry-pick into the `<%= version.stable_branch %>` branch. Remove the label once picked.
    ```
- [ ] In `#development`:

    ```
    @channel

    I am about to create the `<%= version.stable_branch %>` branch. Everything merged into `master`
    after this point will go into next month's release. Only regression and security fixes
    will be cherry-picked into `<%= version.stable_branch %>`.

    Please ensure that merge requests have the correct milestone (`<%= version.to_minor %>` for this release)
    and the `Pick into <%= version.to_minor %>` label.

    From now on, please follow the "After the 7th" process:
    https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#after-the-7th
    ```
- [ ] Create branch `<%= version.stable_branch %>` from CE `master` manually
- [ ] Create branch `<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>` from EE `master` manually
- [ ] In Omnibus create both `<%= version.stable_branch %>` and `<%= version.stable_branch(ee: true) %>` from `master` manually
- [ ] Merge Gitlab CE into EE on stable branches following the [Merging a CE stable branch into its EE counterpart] guide
- [ ] Sync stable branches: CE, EE, and Omnibus to `dev`, CE and Omnibus to `github`
- [ ] Sync master branches to `dev` and `github`, as the CHANGELOG will be automatically updated on master during tagging
- [ ] If needed, sync tags for dependencies (`gitlab-shell`, `gitlab-workhorse`, `gitlab-pages`, `gitaly`) to `dev` and `github` (when applicable)

### First working day after 12th
