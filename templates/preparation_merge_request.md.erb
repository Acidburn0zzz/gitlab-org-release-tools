Main release issue: <%= main_release_issue_url %>

### Summary

This MR prepares `<%= stable_branch %>` for %"<%= milestone %>" (`<%= patch_or_rc_version %>`) by merging `<%= preparation_branch_name %>` into `<%= stable_branch %>`.

### Before the 7th

Merge master into the preparation branch

### After the 7th

#### MR Filter for <%= PickIntoLabel.reference(version) %> MRs

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-<%= repo_ce_or_ee %>/merge_requests?label_name%5B%5D=<%= PickIntoLabel.escaped(version) %>&scope=all&state=merged

#### Note to leave in MRs

```
Picked into https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-<%= repo_ce_or_ee %>/merge_requests/MERGE_REQUEST_ID, will merge into `<%= stable_branch %>` ready for `<%= full_patch_or_rc_version %>`

/unlabel <%= PickIntoLabel.reference(version) %>
```

### Steps

1. Perform automated cherry-picking to reduce the amount of manual picks required. Note this will run for both CE and EE:
   ```
   # In Slack
   /chatops run cherry_pick <%= version.to_ce %>
   ```
1. Cherry-pick remaining commits into this MR using the link for <%= PickIntoLabel.reference(version) %> above.
    - This can be done by checking out `<%= preparation_branch_name %>` locally and using `git cherry-pick -m1 MERGE_COMMIT_SHA`
    - *Note: Copy the merge commit SHA from the "merged into `master`" section of the merge widget.*
1. Push changes every so often and verify that the MR has been included
1. Leave a note in the MR so others can easily see that it is on track to be included in a release.
    - Remove the <%= PickIntoLabel.reference(version) %> label.
1. If there are any conflicts while picking MRs then attempt to resolve them; otherwise, create a new MR against the `<%= preparation_branch_name %>` branch and assign it to the author of the conflicting files.
<% if ee? -%>
1. Merge CE-to-EE using one of the workflows described in the [Merge CE stable changes to EE docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/picking-into-merge-requests.md#merge-ce-stable-changes-to-ee)
    - *Note: Often, after a release has been tagged, the `VERSION` file in `ee` will have a conflict. Accept the `-ee` one*
<% end %>
1. Once this MR is green merge it to stable, preferably with a manual fast-forward merge to minimize waiting time, as described in [Merging preparation MRs into stable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/picking-into-merge-requests.md#merging-preparation-mrs-into-stable)

### Checklist

- [ ] Conflicts resolved
- [ ] No new commits have introduced directly to the stable branch while this MR was in progress. If there are,<% unless ee? %> ensure these are merged into EE and<% end %> check for a green pipeline after merging this MR.
