Release issue: <%= release_issue_url %>

### Summary

This MR prepares `<%= stable_branch %>` for `<%= version %>`.

### Automated cherry-picking

Merge requests labeled <%= PickIntoLabel.reference(version) %> should be
automatically picked into both the CE and EE prepration MRs using the following
ChatOps command:

```sh
# In Slack
/chatops run cherry_pick <%= version.to_ce %>
```

<% if ee? -%>
Once automated cherry-picking has completed, the CE merge request still needs to
be merged into this merge request in order to bring in changes that are not
EE-specific.

Refer to [the documentation][ce-to-ee] for more information.
